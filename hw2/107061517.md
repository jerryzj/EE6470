## Introduction
In this homework, I implemented the median filter through C++ and SystemC with FIFO. The median filter is a digital filtering technique, which often used to remove noise from an image or signal.
## Implementation
* Part I
  * Two modules: Testbench and Median
  * The source code is mainly from the previous homework. But I do some rearrangement job and use sc_fifo instead of sc_event to transmit filter data between testbench and median modules.
  * FIFO-based model to ensure data correctness.

* Part II
  * Three **SC_METHOD**: read_bmp, do_median, and write_bmp.
  * Event-based model to ensure data correctness.
    1. _read_finish: When the data of a mask is ready, read_bmp will send a notify signal, and wait for _median_ready event.
    2. _median_finish: When the median value of R,G, and B three layers is generated, do_median will send a notify  signal and wait for _write_finish event and wait for _write_finish event. 			
    3. _median_ready: When _write_finish event is happen, do_median will send a notify signal to inform read_bmp.
    4. _write_finish: When the median value of R, G, and B three median values are written into output file pointer and the image is not completely filtered.
